# UnitfulConventionalMoles

__This package is now part of UnitfulMoles.jl. Use that instead__


This module defines molecular mass units with conventional molecular weights,
using [Unitful.jl](https://github.com/ajkeller34/Unitful.jl), and
[UnitfulMoles.jl](https://github.com/rafaqz/UnitfulMoles.jl).

Units are available as u"mol{X}":

```
using UnitfulConventionalMoles

>julia 2u"molFe"                                                             
2 mol(Fe) 
```

Conversion to grams using uconvert:

```
julia> uconvert(u"g", 5u"molFe")                                             
279.225 g 

julia> uconvert(u"kg", 200u"molC")                                           
2.4021999999999997 kg 
```

Create custom compounds with the @compound macro:
```
julia> @compound H 2 O
mol(H2O)
```

Molecular weight is calculated automatically:
```
julia> uconvert(u"g", 10molH2O)
180.15 g
```

Atomic weights taken from:

*Atomic weights of the elements 2013 (IUPAC Technical  Report)*

http://doi.org/10.1515/pac-2015-0305

Weights in g are provided with 5 digit precision, using "Conventional" weights
where a range is provided instead of a specific value.
